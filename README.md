Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. 
Increase visibility enabling greater communication
Catch issues early and nip them in the bud
Spend less time debugging and more time adding features
Build a solid foundation
Stop waiting to find out if your codeâ€™s going to work
Reduce integration problems allowing you to deliver software more rapidly

we can use Google cloud build tool for CI which can integrate with Github 

about it:

Google Cloud Build lets you create fast
consistent, reliable builds across all languages.
Automatically build containers or non-container artifacts on commits to your GitHub repository.
Get complete control over defining custom workflows for building, testing, and deploying across multiple environments such as VMs, serverless, Kubernetes, or Firebase.
